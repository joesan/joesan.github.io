## Pi with Arduino

So, our very first integration attempt is to integrate the Raspberry Pi with Arduino. We will use the Raspberry Pi 4. Let us break this down into three parts:

1. Setting up ROS on the Raspberry Pi 4
2. Setting up the serial libraries on the Pi and Arduino
3. Integrate & test the setup

### Raspberry Pi 4 Setup

It is pretty easy to get your hands on the Pi, so just go grab one and follow along. 

The vers first step with setting up your Pi is to install the OS. I prefer to run Ubuntu and ROS is very much compatible with Ubuntu, so why not! We could also install the Raspbian image on the Pi 4, but I prefer to use Ubunntu. 

Hear over to here - https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi and make sure to download the Ubuntu server 20.04 64 bit LTS version (we will use ROS Noetic which is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)

After you have downloaded the image, head over here for a comprehensive installation instruction - https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview

Once you have your Raspberry Pi ready with Ubuntu 20.04, it is time to set up / install ROS!
