## NAVO Home

Navo is an autonomous indoor navigational robot that can get past obstacles using sensors and software. Navo's goal is to be able to not only drive with its 4WD, but also be able to climb stairs, carry stuff around, respond to instructions. Have you seen the robots from Boston Dynamics? If not go check them out. Navo is a thought in that direction, done all by myself.

This project just contains the documentation for the Navo project. I will just write down on some bacis concepts around Robotics in general and the Navo build in particular.
