## About NAVO

THIS IS A WIP! Documentation will be updated as and when I do things for Navo

Here you will find more information on how to build the NAVO robot from scratch. This is a living documentation and I will update it as soon as I have some time!

This project just contains the documentation website content for the Navo project. Topics I find interesting and important is going to be discussed in detail here.
