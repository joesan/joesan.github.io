A few things need to be done before we can assemble the Navo. If you follow the hardwrae section, you would have noticed that we needed a few components that would enable us to manevour the Navo. We first need to understand and establish how the Raspberry Pi (our computer), the Arduino (our Micro-controller) and the L298N H bridge (our Motor controller) work in tandem. Let's take this step by step. Navigate the pages below for an in-depth session on integrating and setting up each one of these components!
